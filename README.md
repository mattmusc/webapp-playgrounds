# Webapp playgrounds

In this repository I'll share some common web-apps stack to practice with various technologies.

The master branch has a plain Spring 5 MVC War webapp written in Kotlin. It has Swagger for documentation.
There's another branch called _angular_ in which I am testing the front end framework Angular 7.
I am planning to create branches for _Vue.js_ and _React_ to test these two libraries also.

## Tech stack

- Spring MVC 5.x and Spring Web 5.x
- Kotlin
- Swagger 2
- Angular 7
